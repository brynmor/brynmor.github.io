Pause for Thought: 25th May 1990

Will and Annie


Skies have melted,<br>
Waterfalls assembled<br>
Scattered moisture,<br>
Afon Machno flowed away<br>
Many times round the earth.<br>

From their back gate<br>
They waved goodbye<br>
To the departing river.<br>

One way out of the valley<br>
For the slate harvest,<br>
Lambs to the slaughter,<br>
And Sunday's preacher from Llanrwst.<br>

I called one afternoon<br>
The first Sunday<br>
After summer time,<br>
Rain swept in from the coast,<br>
Cloud sealed the valley<br>
Till their kitchen was dark,<br>
And the radio played hymns<br>
Or ghosts of hymns.<br>

The tunnel of their winter<br>
Meant pockets of warmth<br>
The workshop, the chapel brazier,<br>
Big kettle on the fire<br>
Timed for a nightcap<br>
And stone hot water bottles.<br>

He would pass through<br>
Wall after wall<br>
Of dark mornings<br>
To chisel boulders<br>
With a sesame touch<br>
That sent slate along the valley<br>
Dust down his lungs.<br>

One way out of the valley<br>
The railway tried once<br>
To blast a tunnel<br>

The track was never laid.<br>
Their line ended too.<br>
They did not trouble the tenth commandment<br>
