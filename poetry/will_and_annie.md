Pause for Thought: 25th May 1990

John Morgan

Will and Annie


Skies have melted,
Waterfalls assembled
Scattered moisture,
Afon Machno flowed away
Many times round the earth.

From their back gate
They waved goodbye
To the departing river.

One way out of the valley
For the slate harvest,
Lambs to the slaughter,
And Sunday's preacher from Llanrwst.

I called one afternoon
The first Sunday
After summer time,
Rain swept in from the coast,
Cloud sealed the valley
Till their kitchen was dark,
And the radio played hymns
Or ghosts of hymns.

The tunnel of their winter
Meant pockets of warmth
The workshop, the chapel brazier,
Big kettle on the fire
Timed for a nightcap
And stone hot water bottles.

He would pass through
Wall after wall
Of dark mornings
To chisel boulders
With a sesame touch
That sent slate along the valley
Dust down his lungs.

One way out of the valley
The railway tried once
To blast a tunnel

The track was never laid.
Their line ended too.
They did not trouble the tenth commandment
