Pause for Thought: 25th May 1990

John Morgan

Will and Annie


Skies have melted,\n
Waterfalls assembled\n
Scattered moisture,\n
Afon Machno flowed away\n
Many times round the earth.\n

From their back gate\n
They waved goodbye\n
To the departing river.\n

One way out of the valley\n
For the slate harvest,\n
Lambs to the slaughter,\n
And Sunday's preacher from Llanrwst.\n

I called one afternoon\n
The first Sunday\n
After summer time,\n
Rain swept in from the coast,\n
Cloud sealed the valley\n
Till their kitchen was dark,\n
And the radio played hymns\n
Or ghosts of hymns.\n

The tunnel of their winter\n
Meant pockets of warmth\n
The workshop, the chapel brazier,\n
Big kettle on the fire\n
Timed for a nightcap\n
And stone hot water bottles.\n

He would pass through\n
Wall after wall\n
Of dark mornings\n
To chisel boulders\n
With a sesame touch\n
That sent slate along the valley\n
Dust down his lungs.\n

One way out of the valley\n
The railway tried once\n
To blast a tunnel\n

The track was never laid.\n
Their line ended too.\n
They did not trouble the tenth commandment\n
