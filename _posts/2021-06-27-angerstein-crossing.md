Angerstein Crossing: proposed closure

### FOI request

I made an FOI request and received the following documents:
- [Covering letter](https://brynmor.github.io/assets/Angerstein/FOI202100801.pdf)
- [List of incidents](https://brynmor.github.io/assets/Angerstein/FOI202100801 Angerstein Wharf foot crossing incidents_redacted.xlsx) - Excel file
- [Document on reporting of incidents](https://brynmor.github.io/assets/Angerstein/NR_L3_INV_3001_902.pdf) - _not much of interest; I'd wondered if they had given specific guidance to drivers to report every minor incident_
- [Operating procedure - Reporting and risk assessing railway crime](https://brynmor.github.io/assets/Angerstein/NR_L3_OPS_045_4.11.pdf)
- [Risk Assessment on crossing - Dec 2019](https://brynmor.github.io/assets/Angerstein/Angerstein FPW_redacted.pdf)


I'd asked for any internal proposals for changes to the line. The covering letter does refers to some proposed improvements to Angerstein Wharf. The [published documentation](https://cdn.networkrail.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/South-East-Kent-route-study-print-version.pdf#page=82) talks about savings calculated at Â£7.8m from reduced running miles if they were able to change the route of the branch line. But this part of the request has mainly been refused:

>As DfT intend to publish an update to their Rail Network Enhancements Pipeline (RNEP) at some point in the near future, which will show whether our suggestions for the development of this line has been approved and will be funded, we consider that the information we hold in response to this question constitutes material that is in the course of completion, and therefore regulation 12(4)(d) applies.
